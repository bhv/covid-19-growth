# covid-19-growth

The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering is providing
[daily COVID-19 CSV files](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) containing the data that are
displayed on their
[ArcGIS dashboard for COVID-19](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).
This repo aims to provide a sensible starting point and some useful functions for ongoing work in
Pandas/Python using the JH data.

The Jupyter Notebook contains a stub demonstrating the use of `lmfit` with these data

No breaking changes to `etl.py` or `us.py` are anticipated, only additional features.

For VSCode users, available as a self-contained, system-independent environment using Docker Remote with Jupyter Notebook integration.

### VSCode/Docker

Clone the repo as above (--recursive!)

Have the [VSCode extension for Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed. Here 'remote' means, in a local Docker container (Debian).

Verify the installation as above.

## Usage

To stay in sync with the Johns Hopkins data
```
./update_data.sh
```

`etl.py` currently provides three dataframes and four manipulation functions. Dataframes are long
format with dates as Pandas timestamps
* `df_cases` All global cases
* `df_deaths` All global deaths
* `df_recovered` All global recoveries
* `filter(df, column, vlaue)` Generic filter
* `for_country(df, country)` Filter by country
* `for_province_state(df, province_state)` Filter by province_state
* `sum_by_date(df)` Group by date and sum case counts 

`us.py` currently provides case dataframes with states split into a new column, and a US
population dataframe
* `df_cases_us` All US cases
* `df_deaths_us` All US deaths
* `df_recovered_us` All US recoveries
* `df_population_us` United Staes population by state, sub_region, and region
